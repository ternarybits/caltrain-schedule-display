# caltrain-schedule-display
Bookmarklet that styles Caltrain's real-time schedule for full-screen display (e.g. at the Caltrain bike station)

## Background

The [Caltrain bike station](http://bikehub.com/caltrain-bike-station/) in SF had a monitor displaying [the train schedule](http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/realtime/stations/sanfranciscostation-mobile.html), but it was hard to read due to the formatting.  I hacked together this bookmarklet that makes it more readable.

## Usage

1. Drag `bookmarklet.js` to you bookmarks bar.
2. Navigate to the [Caltrain real-time schedule](http://www.caltrain.com/schedules/realtime/stations/sanfranciscostation-mobile.html).
3. Run the bookmarklet by clicking on it.

## Development

To make changes to this bookmarklet:

1. Edit `caltrain_schedule_display.js`
2. Use something like [Bookmarklet Crunchinator](http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/bookmarklet.html) to convert it into a bookmarklet.
